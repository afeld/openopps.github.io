[Open Opportunities](http://www.digitalgov.gov/join-digitalgov/open-opportunities-in-digitalgov/) is a United States government program that is creating a network of federal employees working together to build a more effective, efficient, responsive government by sharing skills and collaborating on projects that support the mission of an agency or the government as a whole.

Here’s how Open Opportunities works: You come up with a great idea that would help your workplace, but you and your coworkers don’t have the skills to execute it. Rather than bringing in a contractor, you can post your project idea to Open Opportunities, where other people within your organization can see it and then work on it, if they’d like.

This innovative program has been proven to be effective, 
and while the idea hasn't changed since it was first launched in May 2013, 
the details of how it works have evolved based on Lean Startup principles of
starting small, with quick iteration driven by metrics and qualitative user
research.  

On this website, we will tell the story of how the program was created, the software that fueled it, and what we learned through process.
