---

Program Leader, Lisa Nelson, read "The Lean Startup" by Eric Ries, 
"Lean Analytics", and followed advice to “get outside the building and learn.”

The initial hypothesis:

* Individuals will see the program as a great opportunity.
* They will respond in large numbers.
* Agencies will think this is a good opportunity, too.

Initial communications:

* [Hacking the Bureaucracy One Task at a Time](https://www.digitalgov.gov/2014/06/23/hacking-the-bureaucracy-one-task-at-a-time/)
* [Introductory video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Mha-SnOfzo&list=PLd9b-GuOJ3nHS1TFaULnHi6KIt6l83pnb&index=10)

The initial [3 year roadmap](/initial-roadmap) focused on guiding principles and goals.
